I'll be attending [Amplitudes 2024](https://www.ias.edu/amplitudes2024) at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey in June! There will also be a summer school which I'm looking forward to. Unfortunately, while we didn't get a talk slot, I think that it'll be a good chance to meet with the broader amplitudes community and hear from some more famous people that didn't attend the previous two small conferences.
