My first real paper came out today on the arxiv, entitled "Conservative Black Hole Scattering at Fifth Post-Minkowskian and First Self-Force Order" and written together with my collaborators Gustav Jakobsen, Gustav Mogull, Benjamin Sauer, Johann Usovitsch, and my supervisor Jan Plefka. 

The popular version is this: Ever wondered how when we detect gravitational waves, we know exactly how far it was and what size the black holes were? This only works thanks to high-precision theoretical calculations - but they only get more difficult the more precise you get, and future gravitational wave detectors such as [LISA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_Interferometer_Space_Antenna) will measure more accurately than we can perform these calculations! We broke through multiple barriers to reveal the first fifth-order conservative post-Minkowskian terms using our "Worldline Quantum Field Theory" technique, leveraging many insights from particle physics to the general-relativistic two-body problem.
