I am currently a PhD student in Physics at the Humboldt University in Berlin, supervised by Prof. Jan Plefka in the quantum field theory and string theory group. 

On a surface level, my work is about gravitational waves that are emitted when two black holes interact, and applying techniques from quantum physics to analyze this.

In particular, my work involves calculating gravitational scattering amplitudes using quantum field theory and extracting the classical limit to produce analytical expressions for a post-Minkowskian expansion. We use a special version of quantum field theory, a *worldline quantum field theory*, to simplify the extraction of the classical result in a very natural way. An important task in this process is analyzing the structure of the Feynman integrals in the scattering amplitudes. For example, integration-by-parts relations allow us to vastly simplify them using an algorithm.
